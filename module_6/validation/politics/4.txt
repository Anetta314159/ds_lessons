States members pay to see slight increaseStates members have voted to increase the standard pay of a deputy from £48,213 per annum to around £49,000 per annum in the next political term. 
States members also agreed on a slight decrease to the pay of most committee presidents, meaning the amount taxpayers pay towards deputies’ salaries will remain the same.
Deputies who stand for election and are not voted back into the assembly will be entitled to receive one months’ pay while they secure other employment.
The changes will be implemented in July 2025.
The standard pay for a deputy is currently £48,213 or £15,745 for Alderney representatives.
The presidents of most committees and members of policy and resources are paid £65,135 and the president of policy and resources is paid £84,772.
States members voted to add another category to the pay structure which separates presidents of all committees from members who are not presidents.
An amendment from Deputy Peter Roffey proposing States members should put 5% of their pay into a local pension or lose 2% of it was not approved.
